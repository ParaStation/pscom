NAME
  p4tcp - configure the ParaStation TCP bypass.

SYNOPSIS
  p4tcp [-v] [-a] [-d] [-?] ip_from [ip_to]

DESCRIPTION
  p4tcp configures the ParaStation TCP bypass. Without an argument,
  the current configuration is printed.

  ip_from and ip_to are IP addresses forming an address range for which the
  bypass feature should be activated. Multiple addresses or address
  ranges may be configured by using multiple p4tcp commands.

 NOTE
  To enable the bypass for a pair of processes, the library
  \fIlibp4tcp.so\fR located in the directory \fI/opt/parastation/lib64\fR
  must be pre-loaded by both processes using:

   export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/parastation/lib64/libp4tcp.so

  For parallel and serial tasks launched by ParaStation, this
  environment variable is exported to all processes by default. Please
  refer to ps_environment(5).

  longer use the p4sock protocol.
