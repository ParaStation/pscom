= Runtime Configuration Options

The `pscom_info` tool can be used to print the runtime configuration options of `pscom`, their default values, and their current settings on your system.
Run the following command (after sucessful installation of `pscom`):

[,console]

== Plugin options

=== Customizing plugin priority

By default, `pscom` comes with an internal prioritization of plugins that is used during runtime.
If you want to customize the plugin priorities for your use case you can configure a 'user priority' per plugin using the environment variable `PSP_<arch>` where `<arch>` is the name of the plugin (see list below).
Setting this environment variable to `0` disables a plugin.
Setting a number larger than `0` configures the plugin's priority and overwrites the default priority.
Plugins are sorted first by 'user priority' and second by their internal priority, i.e., equal user priorities lead to a sorting by internal priotities.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `PSP_TCP`
| The user priority of the pscom4tcp plugin.

| `PSP_SHM`
| The user priority of the pscom4shm plugin.

| `PSP_GATEWAY`
| The user priority of the pscom4gateway plugin.

| `PSP_DAPL`
| The user priority of the pscom4dapl plugin.

| `PSP_ELAN`
| The user priority of the pscom4elan plugin.

| `PSP_EXTOLL`
| The user priority of the pscom4extoll plugin. This is mutually with pscom4velo (pscom4velo has precedence over pscom4extoll).

| `PSP_MXM`
| The user priority of the pscom4mxm plugin.

| `PSP_OFED`
| The user priority of the pscom4ofed plugin.

| `PSP_MVAPI`
| The user priority of the pscom4mvapi plugin.

| `PSP_GM`
| The user priority of the pscom4gm plugin.

| `PSP_OPENIB`
| The user priority of the pscom4open plugin.

| `PSP_PSM`
| The user priority of the pscom4psm plugin.

| `PSP_UCP`
| The user priority of the pscom4ucp plugin.

| `PSP_PORTALS`
| The user priority of the pscom4portals plugin.

| `PSP_VELO`
| The user priority of the pscom4velo plugin. This is mutually with pscom4extoll (pscom4velo has precedence over pscom4extoll).
|===

=== Customizing rendezvous thresholds

If you want to customize rendezvous thresholds of plugins you can set the environment variable `PSP_<arch>_RENDEZVOUS` where `<arch>` is the name of the plugin (see list below).
A value of `inf` disables the rendezvous protocol while enforcing eager communication for the respective plugin.
All rendezvous environment variables inherit from the global rendezvous threshold `PSP_RENDEZVOUS`, i.e., if they are not set explicitly on plugin level, the value of `PSP_RENDEZVOUS` is used instead as rendezvous threshold (if `PSP_RENDEZVOUS` is set).
If none of the rendezvous environment variables are set (neither on plugin nor on global level), the default values from the table below are used as rendezvous thresholds.
