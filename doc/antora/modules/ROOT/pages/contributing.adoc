= Contributing

To ensure that all commits conform to the coding style, the pre-commit hook should be activated. Therefore, you have to link this hook from the top-level source directory:

[,console]
----
$ ln -s ../../scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
----

This automatically runs `clang-format`, `cmake-format`, and `cmakelint` on all changed files.

== Requirements
We rely on the following tool versions for checking the coding style and includes:

* `clang-format` 21.1.2
* `cmake-format` 0.6.13 (requires PyYaml 6.0.3 for config parsing)
* `cmakelint` 1.4.3
* `include-what-you-use` 0.23 (enable checks via `-DIWYU_ENABLED=ON` CMake option)

== Usage of Containers
Instead of installing the above-mentioned dependencies locally, a container image can be used instead. In that case, the pre-commit hook has to be prepared to run this container image:

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

podman run --userns=keep-id -w /build --rm -v./:/build:Z <container> ./scripts/hooks/pre-commit
----
