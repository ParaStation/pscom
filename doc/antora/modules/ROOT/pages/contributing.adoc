To ensure that all commits conform to the coding style, the pre-commit hook should be activated. Therefore, you have to link this hook from the top-level source directory:

[,console]
----
$ ln -s ../../scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
----

This automatically runs `clang-format`, `cmake-format` and `cmakelint` on all changed files. Currently, we rely on `clang-format` in version 16.0.6, `cmake-format` in version 0.16.13 and `cmakelint` in version 1.4.2 for checking the coding style.
`cmake-format` configuration file is YAML file that needs `PyYaml` (our version 6.0.1) for parsing.

Additionally, we use "Include What You Use" to avoid upward dependencies. This can be enabled by passing `-DIWYU_ENABLED=ON` to CMake. Currently, we rely on `include-what-you-use` in version 0.22.
